   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Latkes (a.k.a. potato pancakes) are a crowd-pleasing addition to any table — and <br> this family recipe will impress even the pickiest eaters. The secret ingredient? <br> Saltine crackers! The pantry staple replaces all-purpose flour, binds the latkes <br> together, and contributes to the irresistible texture. Though they're traditionally <br> served during Hanukkah, you'll want to enjoy these wonderfully crispy and <br> savory latkes all year long.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
   <div>
       <ul>
           <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
           <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
           <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
           <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>  
           <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li> 
           <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
           <li> ½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
       </ul>
   </div>
   <h2>Steps:</h2>
   <div>
       <ol>
        <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the <br> side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly <br> flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they <br> are an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. <br> Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
       </ol>
